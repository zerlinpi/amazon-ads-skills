# Changelog

This file records user-visible repository releases. The canonical current version is stored in `VERSION`.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Bid and placement optimization now load the shared campaign-objective contract before turning local efficiency into objective-dependent action or sizing.
- `Unknown` campaign objective explicitly caps mission-dependent bid/placement decisions to conservative hold/directional/shadow/experiment/manual-review outcomes rather than inventing action authority.
- Existing connector-capability, sample-sufficiency, realized-exposure, control-interaction, confounder, action-sizing and platform-capability safeguards remain additive and unchanged.

### Research

- Recorded `evalstate/fast-agent` as a high-adoption Apache-2.0 runtime/evaluation reference and rejected importing its runtime machinery because connector attachment, execution and orchestration remain external to this decision library.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-09-21

### Added

- User-facing documentation hierarchy with `docs/README.md`, `docs/CAPABILITIES.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, research/archive boundaries and a much smaller product-entry README.
- Campaign-objective context contract with bounded `Discovery`, `Control`, `Growth`, `Profit`, `Defense`, `Experiment`, and safe `Unknown` roles.
- Operator/community research boundary: practitioner evidence can expose failure modes, but anecdotes and fixed percentages do not become repository defaults.

### Changed

- Superseded 2026-09-07 bootstrap plan/design moved out of active documentation so obsolete 11-Skill/direct-to-main guidance no longer competes with current repository governance.
- Optimization action proposals can preserve campaign-objective context when it materially changes a recommendation.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-21

### Added

- Deterministic SHA-256 and byte-size content identities for the selected Skill package and directly referenced shared resources returned by the custom-host context resolver.
- Explicit platform-integration guidance separating the repository-local resource manifest from the normative MCP Skills wire protocol.
- Repository-wide semantic-version governance with `VERSION` as the canonical source and CI coverage for README/runtime-manifest synchronization.

### Changed

- Release-readiness tests no longer hardcode `1.0.0`; they validate the active semantic version dynamically.
- Pull requests now classify version impact so substantial backward-compatible improvements advance MINOR versions and breaking public contracts advance MAJOR versions.

## v1.0.0

Initial public v1 release of the 15-Skill Amazon Ads decision library.
