# Changelog

This file records user-visible repository releases. The canonical current version is stored in `VERSION`.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-21

### Added

- Deterministic SHA-256 and byte-size content identities for the selected Skill package and directly referenced shared resources returned by the custom-host context resolver.
- Explicit platform-integration guidance separating the repository-local resource manifest from the normative MCP Skills wire protocol.
- Repository-wide semantic-version governance with `VERSION` as the canonical source and CI coverage for README/runtime-manifest synchronization.

### Changed

- Release-readiness tests no longer hardcode `1.0.0`; they validate the active semantic version dynamically.
- Pull requests now classify version impact so substantial backward-compatible improvements advance MINOR versions and breaking public contracts advance MAJOR versions.

## v1.0.0

Initial public v1 release of the 15-Skill Amazon Ads decision library.
